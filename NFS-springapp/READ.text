# In this directory, we combined the spring-boot-mongo server with mongo server.
# Each server has a replicaSet type and the Service associated with the server.
# Spring-boot-mongo is Deployment kind with NodePort Service.
# Mongo is ReplicaSet kind with ClusterIP Service.
# We also connected a local volume of the shared database.

# We can create/start, apply changes, or stop/remove the servers together by:
kubectl apply -f springapp/
kubectl delete -f springapp/
